        <item>  Right	in	the	center	of	Barnaul	on	a	granite	pillar	there	stands	a	vase	made	of	Korgon	porphyry.	The	vase	marks	Barnauls	Kilometre
Zero.	It	is	the	origin	point	of	all	the	roads	of	Altai	Krai.	The	vase	adds	life	to	the	place	and	gives	the	city	its	own	special	appeal.
The	height	of	the	Kolyvan	beauty	is	2	meters,	the	weight	–	1,200	kilos.\n
The	stone	for	the	vase	was	extracted	in	the	Korgon	mine	in	1815.	It	was	not	until	2003	that	the	vase	was	carved	out	of	this	stone.
The	pedestal	is	decorated	with	a	mosaic	made	of	black	gabbro	which	depicts	cardinal	directions	and	twelve	zodiac	signs.	The	total	size	of
the	vase	with	the	pedestal	is	six	and	a	half	meters.\n
The	Kilometre	Zero	is	a	popular	spot	for	get-togethers	and	leisurely	walks.	People	also	come	here	to	make	a	wish.	The	wish-making
ritual	takes	three	steps,	first	you	find	your	own	zodiac	sign	on	the	mosaic,	then	turn	around	three	times	and	throw	a	coin.	If	you	manage	to
            throw	your	coin	onto	the	lid	of	the	vase,	your	wish	will	surely	come	true.

        <item> 2013 marked the 170 anniversary of the Tsarina of Vases, a unique artwork of the Kolyvan masters which was made of green
        undulated Revnevo jasper. The height of the vase is 2,57m. The vase has an oval shape. Its maximum width is 5,04m, the minimum width
        is 3,22m. It is the biggest vase in the world. The vase is displayed in the State Hermitage Museum.\n
        In 2008 Kolyvan craftsmen ventured to make a similar vase. They cut out a replica of the Tsarina of Vases which was 5 times as
        small. The work on this vase continued for a year. Now it is located in the Ob Health Resort (Barnaul, Zmeinogorsky Trakt, 77).\n

            Since 1981 the Kolyvan vase
            installed in the Wedding Palace
            (Lenina Prospekt, 11) has imbued
            newly married couples with its
            positive energy. It contributes to a
            grandiose and solemn atmosphere
            of the ceremonial hall where
            newlyweds perform their first
            dance.

        <item>To make the stone come alive is a dream many masters have.A great contribution to the revival of the art of Florentine mosaic in Altai
            was made by the graduates of the I. Repin School of Art – Olga and Georgy Alekseev.\n
            Through their effort Barnaul acquired new Florentine mosaics of big size. One of the first pictures made in this technique is now
            displayed in the building of Barnaul Port (Ploshchad Bavarina, 8).).

        <item>The Barnaul Palace of Culture of the
            Motor Plant (Ulitsa Titova, 50-a) is

            G. Alekseev under a common name
            The Youth of Altai (1987).

        <item> Barnaul	traces	its	history	back	to	1730.	The	city	emerged	in	the	outlying	districts	of
            the	Russian	Empire	as	a	center	of	mining	industry	which	provided	silver,	copper,	lead	and	gold
            for	the	state	treasury.\n
            The	 first	 monument	that	 appeared	in	 Barnaul	is	 a	 granite	pillar	 –	 the	Demidov
            Obelisk.	The	foundation	for	the	obelisk	was	laid	on	June	18,	1825	on	the	initiative	of	P.K.	Frolov
            who	was	the	head	of	the	Kolyvano-Voskresensky	works.	The	 stones	for	the	obelisk	were
            transported	to	the	city	on	floats	down	the	rivers	Charysh	and	Ob.	The	obelisk	is	14	meters
            high.\n
            th	 The	Demidov	Obelisk	is	of	special	significance.	It	was	erected	in	honor	of	the	100
            anniversary	of	mining	industry	in	Altai.\n
            With	its	elegant	simplicity	of	line	this	most	durable	monument	in	the	city	still	evokes
            admiration.	 Visitors	 still	 marvel	 at	 the	 unsurpassed	 quality	 of	 performance	 of	 Kolyvan
            artisans	and	at	the	beauty	of	the	architecture.

        <item> In honor of the city of
            th Barnauls	 250 anniversary	 in
            1980 an amphora-form vase
            made	 of	 Revnevo	 jasper	 was
            installed	 in	 the	 square	 at	 the
            crossing	of	Pushkina	Street	and
            Lenina	Prospekt.	The	 stone	has
            absorbed	all	the	colors	of	nature.\n
            W h e n y o u f e e l
            downhearted	come	to	enjoy	the
            view	of	the	jasper	vase.	Known	as
            the	 stone	 of	 life	 jasper	 brings
            vitality	 and	 awakens	 a	 sense	 of
            joy		</item>
        <item> In	honor	of	the	50 anniversary	of	Altai	Krai	a	vase	was
            placed	at	the	crossing	of	Lenina	Prospekt	and	Korolenko	Street.
            The	vase	is	made	of	Beloretsk	quartzite	and	resembles	a	bowl
            which	is	filled	with	wishes	of	well-being	and	prosperity.\n
            Stone	 vases	 installed	 in	 the	 streets	 and	 squares	 of
            Barnaul	are	a	true	attraction	of	the	city.	Notice	how	elegantly	and
            gracefully	these	vases	complete	the	composition	of	the	park.\n
            Depending	on	the	season	every	vase	changes	its	color.
            Such	changes	cannot	be	seen	in	a	museum.	Placed	in	the	natural
            urban	 landscape	 and	 being	 so	 close	 to	 city	 dwellers,	 these
            treasures	are	beckoning.

        <item> In	2003	a	sculpture	made
            of	undulated	Revnevo	 jasper	was
            installed	 in	 Barnaul	 Port	 not	 far
            from	the	Chapel	of	St.	Vladimir	in
            token of the memory of V.N.
            Bavarin,	the	first	head	of	the	local
            government	of	the	city	of	Barnaul.\n
            The	inscription	written	on
            the	marble	base	on	the	back	side	of
            the	pedestal	says	–	The	square	is
            named after the head of the
            Barnaul City Administration
            Vladimir Nikolaevich Bavarin
            (1939-2003).\n
            The	sculpture	was	carved
            out	by	Kolyvan	masters	in	the	form
            of	a	half-vase	which	symbolizes	the
            tragic	 and	 untimely	 death	 of	 the
            city	mayor.

            masters	can	be	seen	in	many	places	of

            Palace,	Train	Station,	and	other	public
            buildings	of	Barnaul./n
            These	 vases	 are	 the	 true
            evidence	that	the	Altai	Mountains	are
            still rich in semi-precious and
            precious	stones.	They	prove	that	our
            land	can	be	still	proud	of	artisans	of
            unique	crafts	who	can	bring	life	out	of
            s tone . Through the i r t a l ent

            The	 most	 famous	 modern
            vase,	 the	 Jubilee Vase,	 was	 made	 in
            th 2002	for	the	200 anniversary	of	the
            Kolyvan Stonecutting Factory. A
            wonderful	 vase	made	in	 an	 unusual

            the	Federation	Council	of	the	Federal
            Assembly	of	Russia./n
            In 2003 this vase was
            included into the collection of
            unsurpassed masterpieces of
            th Kolyvan	craftsmen	of	the	19 century
            in	 the	 State	 Hermitage	 Museum.	 A

        <item>Altai stones are very beautiful and they are also very hard. Stone density is 7 units. Color patterns of a rock are determined by the
            environments of mineral deposits and the geological processes which occurred there 400 years ago.\n
            Stones for art works come in a great variety of hues and this fact speaks best for the wealth of color of Altais nature..
