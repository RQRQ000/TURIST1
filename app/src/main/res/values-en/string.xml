        <item> Barnaul	traces	its	history	back	to	1730.	The	city	emerged	in	the	outlying	districts	of
            the	Russian	Empire	as	a	center	of	mining	industry	which	provided	silver,	copper,	lead	and	gold
            for	the	state	treasury.\n
            The	 first	 monument	that	 appeared	in	 Barnaul	is	 a	 granite	pillar	 –	 the	Demidov
            Obelisk.	The	foundation	for	the	obelisk	was	laid	on	June	18,	1825	on	the	initiative	of	P.K.	Frolov
            who	was	the	head	of	the	Kolyvano-Voskresensky	works.	The	 stones	for	the	obelisk	were
            transported	to	the	city	on	floats	down	the	rivers	Charysh	and	Ob.	The	obelisk	is	14	meters
            high.\n
            th	 The	Demidov	Obelisk	is	of	special	significance.	It	was	erected	in	honor	of	the	100
            anniversary	of	mining	industry	in	Altai.\n
            With	its	elegant	simplicity	of	line	this	most	durable	monument	in	the	city	still	evokes
            admiration.	 Visitors	 still	 marvel	 at	 the	 unsurpassed	 quality	 of	 performance	 of	 Kolyvan
            artisans	and	at	the	beauty	of	the	architecture.	</item>

        <item> In honor of the city of
            th Barnaul's	 250 anniversary	 in
            1980 an amphora-form vase
            made	 of	 Revnevo	 jasper	 was
            installed	 in	 the	 square	 at	 the
            crossing	of	Pushkina	Street	and
            Lenina	Prospekt.	The	 stone	has
            absorbed	all	the	colors	of	nature.\n
            W h e n y o u f e e l
            downhearted	come	to	enjoy	the
            view	of	the	jasper	vase.	Known	as
            the	 stone	 of	 life	 jasper	 brings
            vitality	 and	 awakens	 a	 sense	 of
            joy		</item>
        <item> In	honor	of	the	50 anniversary	of	Altai	Krai	a	vase	was
            placed	at	the	crossing	of	Lenina	Prospekt	and	Korolenko	Street.
            The	vase	is	made	of	Beloretsk	quartzite	and	resembles	a	bowl
            which	is	filled	with	wishes	of	well-being	and	prosperity.\n
            Stone	 vases	 installed	 in	 the	 streets	 and	 squares	 of
            Barnaul	are	a	true	attraction	of	the	city.	Notice	how	elegantly	and
            gracefully	these	vases	complete	the	composition	of	the	park.\n
            Depending	on	the	season	every	vase	changes	its	color.
            Such	changes	cannot	be	seen	in	a	museum.	Placed	in	the	natural
            urban	 landscape	 and	 being	 so	 close	 to	 city	 dwellers,	 these
            treasures	are	beckoning.

        <item> In	2003	a	sculpture	made
            of	undulated	Revnevo	 jasper	was
            installed	 in	 Barnaul	 Port	 not	 far
            from	the	Chapel	of	St.	Vladimir	in
            token of the memory of V.N.
            Bavarin,	the	first	head	of	the	local
            government	of	the	city	of	Barnaul.\n
            The	inscription	written	on
            the	marble	base	on	the	back	side	of
            the	pedestal	says	–	“The	square	is
            named after the head of the
            Barnaul City Administration
            Vladimir Nikolaevich Bavarin
            (1939-2003).”\n
            The	sculpture	was	carved
            out	by	Kolyvan	masters	in	the	form
            of	a	half-vase	which	symbolizes	the
            tragic	 and	 untimely	 death	 of	 the
            city	mayor.
        </item>
        <item> Vases	 made	 by	 the	 Kolyvan
            masters	can	be	seen	in	many	places	of
            Barnaul. They adorn Barnaul
            theaters, the Altai Krai State
            Philharmonic Hall, the Wedding
            Palace,	Train	Station,	and	other	public
            buildings	of	Barnaul./n
            These	 vases	 are	 the	 true
            evidence	that	the	Altai	Mountains	are
            still rich in semi-precious and
            precious	stones.	They	prove	that	our
            land	can	be	still	proud	of	artisans	of
            unique	crafts	who	can	bring	life	out	of
            s tone . Through the i r t a l ent
            exclusively	beautiful	Altai	jasper	and
            porphyry “acquire an individual
            touch”	as	the	old	stone	cutters	said.\n
            The	 most	 famous	 modern
            vase,	 the	 Jubilee Vase,	 was	 made	 in
            th 2002	for	the	200 anniversary	of	the
            Kolyvan Stonecutting Factory. A
            wonderful	 vase	made	in	 an	 unusual
            octahedral	form	was	given	as	a	gift	to
            the	Federation	Council	of	the	Federal
            Assembly	of	Russia./n
            In 2003 this vase was
            included into the collection of
            unsurpassed masterpieces of
            th Kolyvan	craftsmen	of	the	19 century
            in	 the	 State	 Hermitage	 Museum.	 A
            replica	of	the	Jubilee Vase	is	installed
            in	 the	 V.M.	 Shukshin	 State	 Drama
            Theatre	of	Altai.
