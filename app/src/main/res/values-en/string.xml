    <string name="kilohistory">  Right	in	the	center	of	Barnaul	on	a	granite	pillar	there	stands	a	vase	made	of	Korgon	porphyry.	The	vase	marks	Barnaul\'s	Kilometre
Zero.	It	is	the	origin	point	of	all	the	roads	of	Altai	Krai.	The	vase	adds	life	to	the	place	and	gives	the	city	its	own	special	appeal.
The	height	of	the	“Kolyvan	beauty”	is	2	meters,	the	weight	–	1,200	kilos.\n
The	stone	for	the	vase	was	extracted	in	the	Korgon	mine	in	1815.	It	was	not	until	2003	that	the	vase	was	carved	out	of	this	stone.
The	pedestal	is	decorated	with	a	mosaic	made	of	black	gabbro	which	depicts	cardinal	directions	and	twelve	zodiac	signs.	The	total	size	of
the	vase	with	the	pedestal	is	six	and	a	half	meters.\n
The	Kilometre	Zero	is	a	popular	spot	for	get-togethers	and	leisurely	walks.	People	also	come	here	to	make	a	wish.	The	wish-making
ritual	takes	three	steps,	first	you	find	your	own	zodiac	sign	on	the	mosaic,	then	turn	around	three	times	and	throw	a	coin.	If	you	manage	to
throw	your	coin	onto	the	lid	of	the	vase,	your	wish	will	surely	come	true.	</string>
